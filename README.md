Messaging. The purpose of this visualization is to look at various economic indicators from countries aroudn the world.  The various slides allow the user to see housing costs, consumer price index, and producer price index to compare the differences between countries in 2018.

Visual Structure. I chose bar graphs because the measurements of discrete variables were easy to compare with bar charts.

Scenes. To support the narrative, I used three pages to serve as scenes. The first scene was the housing costs. It displayed the overall average housing costs, including purchased and rentals. The second scene introduced the consumer price indext. The third scene is producer price indes. The sort function allows the user to organize the chart from largest to smallest - or smallest to largest depending upon the dataset. 

Annotations. The annotations used are primarily tooltips with hover actions.

Parameters. The user can select the desired options as well as sorting the dataset in the chart. 

Triggers. My visualization used html buttons and tooltips.
